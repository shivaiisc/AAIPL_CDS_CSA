    {
        "answer": "D",
        "reasoning": "C is the Engineer, so not the Lawyer. B is in Delhi and dislikes cricket; B is not the Doctor (Doctor is in Mumbai) and not the Lawyer (Lawyer is not in Kolkata, leaving Chennai, which is D’s only valid location). Hence, D is the Lawyer."
    },
    {
        "answer": "B",
        "reasoning": "Roots are 4a and 3a, so b = -7a and c = 12a². Therefore, b² + c = 49a² + 12a² = 61a². Only 549 = 61x9, so a² = 9 → a = ±3. Valid integer value. Hence, option B is correct."
    },
    {
        "answer": "A",
        "reasoning": "Pattern alternates: 3x2=6, 6+3=9, 9x5=45, 45+7=52, 52x11=572. Primes used in order: 2,3,5,7,11. Thus, next number is 572."
