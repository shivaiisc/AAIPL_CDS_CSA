            "D) 361"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sum of roots = 4a + 3a = 7a = -b. Or b = -7a; Product of roots = 4a x 3a = c. Or c = 12a². Now, b² + c = (-7a)^2 + 12a^2 = 49a^2 + 12a^2 = 61a^2.\nComparing the options..\nOption 1: 61a^2 = 3721 ⇒ a^2 = 3721 / 61 = 61, clearly a is not an integer..\nOption 2: 61a^2 = 549 ⇒ a^2 = 549 / 61 = 9, we can have a = -3 or 3 (an integer).\nOption 3: 61a^2 = 427 ⇒ a^2 = 427 / 61 = 7, clearly a is not an integer..\nOption 4: 61a^2 = 361 ⇒ a^2 = 361 / 61, clearly a is not an integer."
