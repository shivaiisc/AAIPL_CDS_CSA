            "question": "On an island, three inhabitants A, B, and C make statements: A says, 'B is a liar.' B says, 'C is a liar.' C says, 'A and B are of different types.' If exactly two are liars, who is the truth-teller?",
            "choices": [
                "A) A",
                "B) B",
                "C) C",
                "D) None"
            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "C's statement is consistent with A and B being liars. If A and B are both liars, then they are the same type, making C's statement false—but C is supposed to be the truth-teller. The only valid configuration with exactly two liars is A and B lying, and C truthfully stating A and B are of different types, which is false—so contradiction. Try C as liar: then A and B must differ. Let A be truthful (B is liar), then B lies (C is liar), which fits. So only consistent solution: A = truth-teller."

            "question": "In a realm with knights (always truthful), knaves (always lie), and spies (can do either), X says: 'If I am a knight, then Y is a spy.' Y says: 'X is a knave.' What is X and Y?",
            "choices": [
                "A) X: knight, Y: spy",
                "B) X: knave, Y: knight",
                "C) X: spy, Y: knave",

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Assume X is a knight -> Y must be a spy (from X's statement). Then Y says 'X is a knave'—which contradicts Y being a spy and telling truth. Now try X as knave: knaves lie, so the implication must be false. But 'If P then Q' is only false when P is true and Q is false, which doesn't apply here—so statement vacuously true. Y as spy saying 'X is a knave' may be true or false. Only consistent config: X is knave (lying), Y is spy (can say anything)."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "If A were a truth-teller, then B would be a liar. But B says A is a truth-teller, which would be a lie if B were a liar, meaning A is a liar—a contradiction. Therefore, A must be a liar, so B is not a liar (i.e., B is a truth-teller). B's statement that A is a truth-teller is false, which fits because A is a liar."
