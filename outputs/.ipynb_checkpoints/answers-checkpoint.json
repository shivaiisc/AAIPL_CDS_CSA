        "reasoning": "Let's break down the relationships: Ravi's maternal grandmother is the sister of Ravi's paternal aunt. This makes Ravi's paternal aunt the daughter of Ravi's maternal grandmother. Since Ravi's maternal uncle is the brother of Ravi's paternal aunt, Ravi's maternal uncle is the brother of Ravi's maternal grandmother. This makes Ravi's paternal uncle the brother of Ravi's maternal grandmother. Therefore, Ravi's paternal uncle's daughter is Ravi's first cousin. Hence, Ravi is the first cousin of his paternal uncle's daughter."
