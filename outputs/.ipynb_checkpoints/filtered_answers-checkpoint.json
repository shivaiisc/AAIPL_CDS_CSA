        "reasoning": "Anaya's mother's brother is Ravi's grandfather. Ravi's mother is the daughter of Anaya's paternal grandmother's only son, meaning Ravi's mother is Anaya's cousin. Therefore, Ravi is Anaya's cousin.",

Lata is the daughter of Ramesh's paternal uncle, making Lata Ramesh's cousin. Since both Ravi and Lata are cousins, Lata is Ravi's cousin.",

        "reasoning": "Assume P is a knight (truth-teller). Then Q is a knave (liar). Q says R is a knight, but since Q is a liar, R is a knave. R says P is a liar, but since R is a knave, P is a knight. This is consistent. Thus, only P is a knight. So there is 1 knight.",

If Y is a truth-teller, then Z is a liar, and X is a liar, satisfying the condition. If Z is a truth-teller, then X is a liar, and Y is a liar, which also satisfies the condition. However, if Y is a truth-teller, Z is a liar, and X is a liar, this fits exactly one truth-teller. Thus, the correct answer is B.",

If Q is truthful, R is truthful, contradicting the condition. If R is truthful, P and Q are the same type, but P says Q is a liar, which would make P a liar, and Q says R is truthful, which would make Q a truth-teller, contradicting.
